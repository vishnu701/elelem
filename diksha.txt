# CHAPTER-1
## INTRODUCTION

In recent years, the banking industry has witnessed a significant transformation with the advent of mobile banking services. As technology continues to evolve, customers are increasingly turning to their mobile devices to carry out various banking transactions, from checking account balances to transferring funds and paying bills. This shift towards mobile banking has not only revolutionized the way customers interact with their banks but has also created a highly competitive landscape among financial institutions striving to offer the best mobile banking experience. In this comparative study, we will analyze and assess the mobile banking services offered by two prominent private banks in India – HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank.

HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank are two of the largest and most recognized private sector banks in India, with a wide customer base and a strong presence across the country. Both banks have made substantial investments in technology and digital infrastructure to enhance their mobile banking offerings, making them prime candidates for a comparative analysis. The objective of this study is to provide insights into the mobile banking services of these two banks, focusing on various aspects such as user interface, features, security measures, customer support, and overall customer satisfaction.

The importance of mobile banking cannot be overstated, especially in a country like India, where smartphone penetration has been steadily increasing. With the government's push towards a digital economy and the rise of FinTech companies, banks are under immense pressure to provide seamless and user-friendly mobile banking solutions. Customers today demand convenience, speed, and security when it comes to managing their finances on the go, and banks must rise to the challenge.

This study will begin with an overview of the mobile banking services offered by HDFC Bank, examining its features, functionalities, and user interface. We will then delve into a similar analysis of ICICI Bank's mobile banking services, comparing and contrasting them with those of HDFC Bank. We will also consider factors such as security measures, customer feedback, and the availability of additional services like loans, investments, and insurance through the mobile banking platforms of both banks.

The goal of this comparative study is to provide valuable insights to both banks and customers alike. Banks can use the findings to identify areas for improvement and stay competitive in the digital banking landscape. Customers, on the other hand, can make informed decisions about which bank's mobile banking services align better with their preferences and needs. As technology continues to advance, mobile banking will only become more integral to the banking experience, making this study all the more relevant and timelier.

Today, mobile banking has become an integral part of the Indian banking industry, with banks continuously innovating to offer a seamless and secure mobile banking experience. The growth trajectory of mobile banking is expected to remain upward as technology continues to advance and more customers embrace digital banking solutions.

## 1.3 THEORETICAL BACKGROUND:

### 1.3.1 MOBILE BANKING:

Mobile banking refers to the use of smartphones and mobile devices to access and manage banking services and transactions. It allows customers to perform various financial activities such as checking account balances, transferring funds, paying bills, and even applying for loans, all through a convenient and user-friendly mobile app. Mobile banking has revolutionized the way individuals interact with their banks, providing 24/7 access to their accounts and empowering them to conduct banking tasks anytime, anywhere. With the growing reliance on smartphones, mobile banking has become an integral part of the modern banking experience, offering convenience, security, and efficiency to customers.

**Meaning:** Mobile banking refers to the use of a smartphone or mobile device to access and manage one's bank accounts, perform transactions, and conduct financial activities remotely.

### 1.3.2 IMPORTANCE OF MOBILE BANKING:

**1. Accessibility:** Mobile banking allows customers to access their bank accounts and perform transactions anytime and anywhere, eliminating the constraints of physical branch visits. This accessibility is particularly valuable for those in remote or underserved areas.

**2. Convenience:** With mobile banking apps, customers can check account balances, transfer funds, pay bills, and even apply for loans with just a few taps on their smartphones. This convenience saves time and reduces the need for in-person interactions.

**3. Cost-Effective:** Mobile banking reduces the operational costs for banks by minimizing the need for brick-and-mortar branches and staff. These cost savings can be passed on to customers in the form of lower fees and competitive interest rates.

**4. Financial Inclusion:** Mobile banking has played a pivotal role in promoting financial inclusion by enabling individuals without access to traditional banking services to participate in the formal financial system. It has helped bridge the gap between the banked and unbanked populations.

**5. Security:** Mobile banking apps are equipped with robust security measures, such as biometric authentication and encryption, to safeguard customers' financial information and transactions.

**6. Real-Time Transactions:** Mobile banking offers real-time transaction processing, ensuring that customers have up-to-date information on their account activities, enhancing transparency.

**7. Digital Payments:** Mobile banking has facilitated the adoption of digital payment methods like UPI, making cashless transactions more prevalent and reducing the reliance on physical currency.

### 1.3.3 ADVANTAGES OF MOBILE BANKING:

**1. Convenience:** Mobile banking offers unparalleled convenience as it allows users to access their bank accounts, make transactions, and check balances from the comfort of their smartphones. This eliminates the need to visit physical bank branches.

**2. 24/7 Accessibility:** Mobile banking services are available 24/7, enabling users to perform banking activities at any time, including weekends and holidays. This accessibility is especially beneficial for individuals with busy schedules.

**3. Real-time Transactions:** Mobile banking enables real-time transactions, including fund transfers, bill payments, and mobile wallet top-ups. Users can receive instant notifications for all transactions, ensuring transparency.

**4. Financial Management:** Mobile banking apps often provide tools for budgeting, expense tracking, and financial planning. This helps users manage their finances effectively and make informed decisions.

**5. Enhanced Security:** Banks employ advanced security measures such as biometric authentication, one-time passwords (OTPs), and encryption to protect mobile banking transactions. Lost or stolen physical wallets or cards are not a concern.

### 1.3.4 DISADVANTAGES OF MOBILE BANKING:

**1. Security Concerns:** While mobile banking offers security features, it is not entirely immune to cyber threats. Phishing, malware, and hacking attempts can put users' financial information at risk if they are not cautious.

**2. Limited Services:** Some complex banking transactions, such as opening new accounts or applying for loans, may still require a visit to a physical bank branch. Mobile banking may not offer the full range of services available at brick-and-mortar locations.

**3. Connectivity Issues:** Mobile banking relies on internet connectivity, and users in areas with poor network coverage may face difficulties in accessing their accounts or conducting transactions.

**4. User Awareness:** Not all users are tech-savvy or well-informed about mobile banking practices. Lack of awareness can lead to mistakes, such as sharing sensitive information or falling victim to scams.

**5. Dependency on Technology:** Mobile banking is reliant on smartphones and technology. Technical glitches, software updates, or device malfunctions can disrupt banking services, causing inconvenience to users.

## LITERATURE REVIEW

## 2.1 Category 1: Research Papers on HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank

**1.** In their 2019 study, Sujeet Kumar Sharma and Manisha Sharma explore the factors influencing the actual usage of mobile banking services. They extend the DeLone & McLean information systems success model and examine the relationships between satisfaction, intention to use, service quality, information quality, trust, and system quality in the context of mobile banking. The study, based on data from 227 Omani residents, employs structural equation modeling and neural network analysis to validate their research model, revealing the crucial role of satisfaction and intention to use as determinants of actual usage. The study provides both theoretical and practical insights into mobile banking adoption.

**2.** In their research article titled "Lakshmappa Kasappa and Basavaraj C S (2017) assessed the financial performance of India's two largest private sector banks, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank in their "Comparative Performance Analysis of ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank". The study highlighted that during the period under investigation, HDFC Bank exhibited a higher rate of growth in net profit compared to ICICI Bank. Additionally, HDFC Bank outperformed ICICI Bank in terms of the number of branches, while ICICI Bank showed better growth in the number of ATMs. Based on the aggregate results of selected parameters, the study concluded that HDFC Bank demonstrated better financial performance than ICICI Bank during the study period.

**3.** Giovanis et al. (2019) A literature review was conducted to compare potential users' behavioral intentions to adopt mobile banking (MB) with four well-established theoretical models: the theory of planned behavior, the technology acceptance model, the unified theory of technology acceptance and use, and the decomposed theory of planned behavior (DTPB). The research uses structural equations modeling to examine the relevance of the fit, explanatory power and statistical significance of the path coefficients using data from 931 potential clients in Greece. An improved DTPB model that includes perceived risk (PR) has been shown to be most effective in explaining consumers' intentions to use MB services. The main force of adoption has been developed as customer attitude, which is based on rationally assessed MB attributes (interest, convenience and adaptability). The research also emphasized the impact of consumer perceptions of information, opportunities and resources for service use, as well as the impact of personal and impersonal social attitudes on MB adoption. Moreover, attitudes have been shown to be significantly influenced by perceived risk, which reduces the desire to use methyl bromide services.

## 2.2 Category 2: ICT Services and Customer Impact

**4.** Based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), this empirical research explores the factors influencing Malaysians' willingness to use mobile banking services. In Malaysia, a self-administered questionnaire was administered and 175 valid responses were examined using multiple and factorial regression analysis. Utility, perceived simplicity, relative advantages and personal innovation were all found to positively influence the intention to use mobile banking services. However, social expectations were shown to be insignificant and adoption was found to be inversely related to perceived risk. These findings provide insights that can help banks, service providers and software developers in Malaysia increase customer reliance on mobile banking.

**5.** The article by Payne, Peltier and Barger (2021) examines the factors that influence the value co-creation process and consumer comfort with AI-based mobile banking service platforms. The article proposes a conceptual model that links five antecedents: baseline perceptions of current bank service delivery; service delivery configuration benefits; general data security; safety perceptions of specific mobile banking services; and perceptions of AI service delivery. The article tests the model using data from 218 respondents and structural equation modeling. The article finds that service delivery and customer's role in value co-creation change as AI is introduced into a digital self-service technology channel. The article also suggests that AI-based mobile banking service platforms offer more utilitarian than hedonic value propositions.

**6.** Ayman Al-Smadi, Ahmed Shuhaiber and Louie N. Using the Scopus database, they conducted bibliometric and content analyzes on 1,206 research publications. According to the report, mobile communication systems are the most common problem in phone banking over time. The authors emphasized the need to monitor future developments, considering global influences, and offered a framework for future research in the field. The research filled a gap in the literature, providing a detailed and comprehensive multi-period analysis of m-banking. (Ayman A. Alsmadi et al., 2022).

## 2.3 Category 3: Comparison Studies of Mobile Banking Services

**7.** The article by Meena Sharma (March 2023) compares the profitability of two major private banks in India, HDFC and ICICI, based on their total income, total expenses and net profit. The article uses secondary data from the annual reports of the banks for a period of five years. The article applies various statistical tools such as mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation and t-test to analyze the data. The article concludes that HDFC bank has better performance than ICICI bank in terms of profitability and efficiency.

**8.** Ahmed Mahdi Abdulkareem's article titled A 2020 publication in Global Journal of Management and Business Research (GJMBR) "Profitability Performance of HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank: An Analytical and Comparative Study" examines the profitability performance of two prominent private banks in India, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank. To analyze data on deposits, sectors, channels, investments and developments, the research uses various mathematical and statistical techniques such as ratios, trends and correlations. The research findings indicate that HDFC Bank outperforms ICICI Bank in terms of generating profitability. The study emphasizes the importance of analyzing profitability metrics to understand banking strategies in a competitive market

**9.** According to the article by Shodh Sarita (2020), mobile banking is a significant innovation in the banking sector that offers convenience and flexibility to customers. The article compares the customer satisfaction levels of two leading banks in India, ICICI and HDFC, based on five factors: simplicity, accessibility, accuracy, efficiency and security. The article uses correlation analysis to examine the relationship between these factors and customer satisfaction. The article finds that ICICI has an advantage over HDFC in terms of simplicity, accessibility and efficiency, while HDFC scores higher on accuracy and security. The article provides insights into the competitive strategies of both banks to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty

**10.** The article by Ho, Wu, Lee and Pham (2020) explores the factors that affect the behavioral intention to adopt mobile banking among consumers in Taiwan and Vietnam. The article uses a combination of three theoretical models: Diffusion of Innovations (DOI), Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Decomposed Theory of Planned Behavior (DTPB) to develop an integrated model that examines the influence of subjective norms, compatibility, perceived usefulness, perceived risk, attitude, self-efficacy, facilitating conditions and perceived behavioral control on the intention to adopt mobile banking. The article collects data from 400 respondents in Taiwan and 400 respondents in Vietnam and analyzes them using structural equation modeling. The article finds that subjective norms, compatibility, perceived usefulness, perceived risk and attitude have significant effects on the intention to adopt mobile banking in both countries, while self-efficacy, facilitating conditions and perceived behavioral control have different effects depending on the country. The article also discusses the implications of the findings for financial institutions and mobile service providers.

## 2.4 IDENTIFYING GAPS

While the existing research provides valuable insights into the financial performance and behavioral aspects of mobile banking adoption, there is a notable gap when it comes to directly comparing the mobile banking services of specific banks like HDFC and ICICI. The prior literature tends to focus on either financial performance or broader factors influencing mobile banking adoption, but there is limited research that directly compares the user experience, features, and satisfaction levels offered by these banks.

The literature review highlights the significance of understanding the profitability performance of banks like HDFC and ICICI, shedding light on the financial aspects of these institutions. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of factors such as customer attitudes, perceived risk, and utility in influencing mobile banking adoption. The integration of AI into banking services and the evolving dynamics of customer roles are also discussed.

The gap in the literature lies in the absence of a direct comparison of mobile banking services offered by these banks, which is the focal point of the current research. This study aims to address this gap by conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank's mobile banking services, providing insights into user satisfaction, features, and customer preferences.

## 4.1 HYPOTHESIS:

### 4.1.1 ICICI BANK

**Null Hypothesis(H0):** There is no significant relationship between the frequency of encountering technical issues while using mobile banking services and overall satisfaction with the mobile banking services of ICICI Bank.

**Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** There is significant relationship between the frequency of encountering technical issues while using mobile banking services and overall satisfaction with the mobile banking services of ICICI Bank

**CONTINGENCY TABLE:**

| Response         | Very Often | Often | Occasionally | Rarely | Never | Total |
|------------------|------------|-------|--------------|--------|-------|-------|
| Strongly Disagree| 2          | 2     | 6            | 5      | 6     | 21    |
| Disagree         | 3          | 4     | 4            | 6      | 1     | 18    |
| Neutral          | 3          | 5     | 10           | 30     | 20    | 68    |
| Agree            | 2          | 3     | 17           | 50     | 12    | 84    |
| Strongly Agree   | 0          | 0     | 25           | 5      | 0     | 30    |
| **Total**        | **10**     | **14**| **62**       | **96** | **39**| **204**|

Calculation of the expected frequencies using the formula:
Expected frequency = (row total * column total) / grand total

For example, the expected frequency for the cell in the first row and first column is:
Expected frequency = (21 * 10) / 204 = 1.03

Doing this for every cell, we get:

**EXPECTED FREQUENCY:**

| Response         | Very Often | Often | Occasionally | Rarely | Never | Total |
|------------------|------------|-------|--------------|--------|-------|-------|
| Strongly Disagree| 1.03       | 1.44  | 6.35         | 9.18   | 3     | 21    |
| Disagree         | 0.88       | 1.23  | 5.35         | 7.75   | 2.78  | 18    |
| Neutral          | 3.33       | 4.65  | 20.2         | 29.18  | 10.63 | 68    |
| Agree            | 4.12       | 5.76  | 25           | 36.12  | 13.24 | 84    |
| Strongly Agree   | 1.47       | 2.05  | 8.9          | 12.88  | 4.7   | 30    |
| **Total**        | **10**     | **14**| **62**       | **96** | **39**| **204**|

Now using the Chi-square formula, Σ[(O - E)^2 / E], we get:

Chi-square = [(2-1.03)^2 / 1.03] + [(3-0.88)^2 / 0.88] + ... + [(4.7-0)^2 / 4.7] ≈ 35.83

**Interpretation:**
Looking at a chi-square distribution table, with (5-1) * (5-1) = 16 degrees of freedom, at a level of significance of 0.05, we find the critical value to be approximately 26.3.

Since our calculated chi-square value of 35.83 is greater than the critical value of 26.3, we reject the null hypothesis. Thus, we conclude that there is significant relationship exists between the frequency of encountering technical issues and overall satisfaction with the mobile banking services of ICICI Bank.

### 4.1.2 HDFC BANK:

**Null Hypothesis(H0):** There is no significant relationship between the frequency of encountering technical issues while using mobile banking services and overall satisfaction with the mobile banking services of HDFC Bank.

**Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** There is significant relationship between the frequency of encountering technical issues while using mobile banking services and overall satisfaction with the mobile banking services of HDFC Bank

**OBSERVED FREQUENCIES:**

| Strongly Agree   | 1          | 2     | 6            | 17     | 9     | 35    |
| **Total**        | **12**     | **23**| **56**       | **76** | **26**| **204**|

Calculating the expected frequencies using the formula:
Expected frequency = (row_total * column_total) / grand_total

For example, for Strongly Disagree and Very often,
Expected frequency = (9 * 12) / 204 = 0.53

Similarly computing the expected frequencies for each cell,

**EXPECTED FREQUENCIES:**

| Observation      | Very often | Often | Occasionally | Rarely | Never | Total |
|------------------|------------|-------|--------------|--------|-------|-------|
| Strongly Disagree| 0.53       | 1.01  | 2.48         | 3.54   | 1.43  | 9     |
| Disagree         | 1.82       | 3.48  | 8.56         | 12.22  | 4.92  | 31    |
| Neutral          | 2.94       | 5.61  | 13.76        | 19.65  | 7.92  | 50    |
| Agree            | 3.98       | 7.6   | 18.67        | 26.67  | 10.73 | 68    |
| Strongly Agree   | 2.73       | 5.22  | 12.82        | 18.29  | 7.35  | 35    |
| **Total**        | **12**     | **23**| **56**       | **76** | **26**| **204**|

To calculate the Chi-square statistic, use the formula:
Chi-square = Σ [(O - E)2 / E]

For example, for Strongly Disagree and Very often,
Chi-square= [(1-0.53)2 / 0.53] +[(2-1.03)^2 / 1.03] + [(3-0.88)^2 / 0.88] + ... + [(4.7-0)^2 / 4.7] ≈ 35.83

= 0.42

Likewise calculating Chi-square for each cell and adding, we get a total Chi-square value of 38.05

**Interpretation:** Using a chi-square distribution table with (5-1) * (5-1) = 16 degrees of freedom and a significance level of 0.05, the critical value is 26.296.

Since our calculated chi-square value of 38.05 is greater than the critical value of 26.296, we reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is significant relationship between the frequency of encountering technical glitches while using mobile banking services and overall satisfaction with the mobile banking services of HDFC Bank.
